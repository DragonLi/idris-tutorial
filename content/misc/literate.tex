\subsection{Literate programming}

Like Haskell, \Idris{} supports \emph{literate} programming.
If a file has an extension of \texttt{.lidr} then it is assumed to be a literate file.
In literate programs, everything is assumed to be a comment unless the line begins with a greater than sign \texttt{>}, for example:

\begin{lstlisting}
> module literate

This is a comment. The main program is below

> main : IO ()
> main = putStrLn "Hello literate world!\n"
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
An additional restriction is that there must be a blank line between a program line (beginning with \texttt{>}) and a comment line (beginning with any other character).

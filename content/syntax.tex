\section{Syntax Extensions}

\Idris{} supports the implementation of Embedded Domain Specific Languages (EDSLs) in several ways~\cite{res-dsl-padl12}.
One way, as we have already seen, is through extending \texttt{do} notation.
Another important way is to allow extension of the core syntax.
In this section we describe two ways of extending the syntax: \texttt{syntax} rules and \texttt{dsl} notation.
